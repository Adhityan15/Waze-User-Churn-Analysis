This project is part of the Coursera "Get Started with Python" course. The goal is to explore and analyze Waze user data to identify patterns related to user churn.

## 📁 Dataset
- `waze_dataset.csv`: Provided by Coursera
- 2,000 users with activity and churn status

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy

## 🔍 Key Steps
- Data import and inspection
- Handling missing values
- Grouping and analyzing user behavior
- Creating new features (km per drive, drives per day)
- Comparing churned vs. retained users

## 📊 Insights
- 18% of users churned
